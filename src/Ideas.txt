Kat has a plan to steal him back with the helicopter
Liz: that's insane.  He's licensed.  Um, hello, Liz, shall we discuss how we got your watermak removed?
Well gee liz.  you look  little fuzzy around the edges.  Like maybe someone used a fill tool to mask you 
out of a jpeg.  Did matt pay $9.65 for you?  I don't seem to recall that.

Pah!  Grown up talk.  You lost me at dangerous.
He's not just some image.  He's my friend and I'm getting him back.

That's not even the bad part.

This is preposterous!
We can't delay the rocket launch just because there may be some bunny on some asteroid.
How do we even know if we can believe the girls?
Yeah, why should we believe the girls?
Maybe they are just making this all up!
Believe the girls?

Why should anybody believe the girls?
Old lady Jezera!
That is a fine question, indeed.
Why believe the girls.

Look how they prance about,
Without a thought in their heads,
Stuck in a flight of fancy, like some errant Jurrassic fly entombed in amber.
Ah girls...
They are enchanted by the sparkle, the shimmer of something disappearing around the bend.
The girls see the glimmer, the see the patterns in the sky.
For the girls have not yet 


Ugg.  Nobody believes in that magic.  Come on gang, let's go to my house and watch bugflix.
Yay, bugflix!
I believe you Old Lady WillowFeather, 
I see the magic in the glitter.
I'm just, I'm just shy.
No girl.
You are not shy.
But I act shy.
Well that is quite different, and it will pass.
You have your feet in both worlds, my dear.
A time will come when 

Its's a bit of a niave proxy.


I see the cracks in the sky, like a cobweb, 
My dear, that is the fabric of the universe.
Tell me girl.  Do you see the gazelle.
I am old and I do not see so far any more.

Yes, it is bounding away from the lion.
And by the river.
The Elephant.  She's teaching her babies how to spout.
What you and I see, when we look up at the stars.
The others can't see them like we do.
They just see the pin pricks of light.
Yes, I always thought that was 

She needs to find her soul sister, who turns out to be Kat.
--
The girls somehow get recruited to find all the autocompletes
And try and figure out if they are passwords.
Here are some really bad passwords.
I like bunnies.
So they ask baby troll 

Quickly, come to me girl.
When you look at the stars.
Do you see the lion?

Liz had an evil step mother, who taught her to be an alpha queen.
------------------
-- scene [0] - alpha queen showdown with evil queen defeating good queen
---- upon defeat, good queen shoots her light beam out into the universe.
It bounces off the moon using the equilateral distance around the sun.

like stonehenge, and they don't kwon why.
Liz is troll instincts.

oh them, they go up there every 71 years 
- scene [1] - meet Kat.
- scene [3] - granny at the troll caves

ugghhh... mom, why do I need to stay here with you?
I want to pick razzle berries with you.
How come my sisters get to go?
You know why.
Because the I see the patterns in the stones.
Ugghhh... but that's why you make me play with the trolls all day?
Varnya, you have a chance that we never had.  We are just radish farmers.
And my mother before me.  We are proud radish farmers, we speak with the
elements, the soil earth and the sun 
Uggh... there's plenty of kids there that can make the rock glow.
But none like you, Vera.

One day we will get the 4 goblets and fly away from here on a giant red bird.
Ok crazy dog. 

Vera, do you know how the trolls chip the rocks with their hammers without breaking
the jewels in the ?
They listen to the rhythm and 
I know. I hear it too.

Ahhh!!! sneak attack!!!
Ahh, stop, what did I do to deserve this?
Liz, we were calling your name for like 50 times,
but you were just staring off into space.
Where do you go when you were like that?
I was just pretending.
She literally does that for hours.
It's like a dream, but it's so real.  I know all these people in there.
And creatures.  I need to help the Queen.

There is some bad boy across town who has the same visions.
They two meet.  But she is acting strong and he is acting weak.











And they say you are shy.

Turn 
Look 

Um, whatever, 

the character always loops, and the mother always becomes the daughter.
They girls go to Liz loop, where if you go in, you never come out.
Her mother told her the riddle, but she never learned the answer.

Wait everyone's parents died in a tragic accident?
I lost my bunny.
Look, I learned this in school.
Look, I understand Zorblat.
Zorblat is just developing sympathy for me.





recall forbidden island story.
I didn't teach you to steal?

There are scouts scouring the galaxy for girls that have the magic.
You, do you know why you are holding that in your hand?
Because I lost my marbles and 
Because we stole it from the Troll, and it was going to fall in the.
And it was all some giant mistake.

Ah girl.... How sweet you are.
You have that

This is my --- moment.
The stone in the woods.

What did the witch say, spit it out?
The witch said that the moon stone is a beacon.

A what what?
Stop gibbering rabbit!
Make those words make sense!
The moonstone 

The moonstone is reporting the pulse from the laser back to the other planet.

The stone is sending a message back to 

It was a beacon.

-----------
Wow.
Remember what that girl Kat said?
Who?
The girl with the super intense smile...
Oh yeah, I remember her.
I always called her Captain Crazy Pants.
She was always trying to get some bun to some pig or something...
Yeah.
What was that all about?
I have no idea.
Where is she?
I haven't seen her in forever.
She started talking really weird after that Troll Cave Rap battle.
Didn't she win it?
And then she started talking about building a helicopter...
That was like all she would talk about.

-----------
-----------
But she said, if we could get the bun down from the tree...
We could unlock Dress Quest...
Ha! Dress Quest?  You really believe that story?
Yeah, I do.  I believe her.
Wait, you believe that there were a bunch of princesses, that would pay you to get them dresses...?
Ha!  This place is kind of weird but that sounds like sound a little far fetched...
Do you believe in Zorblat too?
And what about Liz?
She got really weird.
All that stuff about Zorblat, and the banana queen...
She lost her marbles for real...
I know.
But just imagine for a second if they were right.
What if all that crazy stuff was true?
I mean, where are Liz and Kat now?
Isn' t that kind of weird, that they both just disappeared...


-----------
Well I do not believe those stories.
No one else has ever heard of Dress Quest.
This game has been called Troll Game for as long as any one can remember.
But she knew the names of all the old witches.
And she could literally get anything.  The bun, the pin.
Yeah, that was pretty amazing.
But have you seen her around?
No.  No one has ever since...
...ever since when.
When was the last time you saw Liz or Kat.
Well.... um... I guess ever since the log got that glitch.
Now no one is allowed to go near the log.
That's exactly my point.
I think we can find some kind of clue if we go to the log.
Clue to what?
A clue to why we are here.
What this game is all about.
And what about all the lost rabbits.
Did you ever wonder about that?
Why is everyone always losing their rabbits?
It's this whole thing that Matt's going through.
Don't worry about it.
I think I can get this handled.
Matt!!
Matt!!!!!
Can you stop with the lost bunny thing???
Sorry... no can do!
Look Britta, I love all those fairy tales too, but I'm working really hard to get a part on a Bugflix show.
You should too.

Ideas

- Make a world that is all your own, like a kingdom, and each kid has their own
- Landing page, you hurtle down from outer space and crash land on the large WWT.
- Weird Whatever Thing
- I could have pivot tables for a mini game, or any kind of educational skill, for that matter.
- ear training mini game

Stubtown - where all the story stubs are.
If enough kids upload recordings, they get made into real places...

Wake up from a dream and be a completely different character in a different story, trying to find a way back.
Use day after tomorrow plot

Woman jumps out of orbit to find a clue to find her daughter.

Britta is travelling around the star system, scavenging amythest to allow her to jump down into strange planets to look for her mom and find her mom...

So if action causes reaction, when I get older when I jump out of orbit, does that means some else gets younger?
We could build a machine
That would be insanely huge.
Not of we use recursion?


They find the old fractal engine that the Orcs built, and little Fluff Buns hops into it.
Over time, the fractal will settle, and reveal a truth. 

Zoom out to the kid that invented the fractal engine.
She learns how to weave herself into it.

-----
Hey, that's a prime!
Yup. I'm here to find that flower.
I'll find it.
How? That's impossible.
I'll grab time like twine and and unwind it.
I'll trim our world down to the key things that we know
and braid them back in a recursive pattern.
We will have a parallel universe.
And we can cycle around in it forever, or until we find the bunny...
Can you believe it, we will find bunny!
But how will we get out?
We won't get out.  It is one way.

Britta, calm down.  Remember what we agreed to when I said you could read Hardball for Women?
This is exactly what we talked about.
I am not child mother.
Oh but you are.  I'll be honest with you dear.
I have to make decisions every day that would make most adults curl up in a ball and weep.



  Ummm, let em get this straight, you are going to find the extents of the universe, and patch them into a fractal engine as a base unit in a recursive universe
So that if you look into the past, you can see the future?
Yeah. Exactly.
That would take like 39 hours!


Hey, that's a prime!

Lucinda Lilyfeather has secret identity as a bad girl.
Kinda like Princess in Black but cool.

OMG I always pretend to get hurt when I'm at her house, because her mom
is so new agey when she takes care of me.

I need you to stop lying.
Ahh ha ha ha ha!
No really.  It really means a lot to me.
Ok, well I never really looked at it that way.
Lying is bad, and even though it helps you get a giant laundry list of cool things
I'm going to stop lying, just for you.
Oh shoot.  That was a lie.
Wait, wait. Starting now...
Besides, when people find out you are a liar, they will not want to be your friend.
Oh geez.  That does kinda shine a new light on it.
people I don't like.
Oh shoot.  I messed up again...
Ok, starting... now...



Have you ever noticed that grown ups aren't that into glitter any more?
Yeah, I think life hammers it our of them.
Yeah, I see it in some of the graders even.
You try to play Elves with them and suddenly they are talking about a test they have at Elf Academy or something.
Yeah, that freaked me out.  I literally just froze and I couldn't move and then drool started pooling up in my mouth,but my face 
was like totally frozen.  I was just staring at him, like something in my brain got disconected.
And then managed to turn my head a little and the drool overflowed and literally spilled down my chin.
And now rogue was just staring and me... but when he drool came out he screamed like a little girl.
Adn I dont mean like us, I mean like a 2 year old girl, and his mom ran over, because she thought he had gotten stung by a bee or a wasp, or those ones with the 
long creep legs 
a yellow jacket

I didn't do anything.
Just look at it.

"  Missy Meow"
"---------------"
  Missy Meow and the mystery of the missing muffins...
  Meow.
  Meee-oooooooooooowwwwwwwww....
  Burp.
 
  Meet me.
  I'm Missy.
  Call me Missy Meow.
  If you hit me with a mystery,
  I'll figure it out.
 
  Freezer Fishy?
  Missing Muffins?

  I can find your kitten cousin
  fifteen dozen missing muffins.
  But I'll need to keep a couple
  for my creepy cousin Krista, if she's coming

  And this is Mitzy, my ritzy cousin
  She says:
  You're always hissing,
  throwing fits, and fussing

  She's right. I wish I wasn't
  It's just that people push my buttons



My dad's always saying to stop screaming
When I'm latched onto his leg in the line at Target
like a lost lemur
"We're not leaving!", I sob,
And I'm heaving,
And I'm trying to stop him,
by bobbing and weaving
You didn't buy me any of the thigns I needed!

And through the tears, I can see my snot leaving a giant splotch
on the massive pink dog I'm squeezing...
He has to buy it now!
The girl's a genius
My gosh the details...

So that's how she got Pinky...???
Wowww... Just wow...

I need to write this down.
Does someone have a pen?
just use the alphabet blocks.
Oh right.
I just need the ones that spell out CRAZY...


My mom says it's all part of my process
When the tears gush out of my eyes
like those old creaky faucets
In the art room sink
The one that's splatted with cartoon ink?
I thought that was Barb's barfed blue drink..

She says may be I will grow out of it.
I go in my room and shout a bit.
The I pout and sit.

But I'm like Elsa, my powers keep increasing.
This recent weekend I started speaking sweedish
And my house is freakin freezing.

When I'm with Mitzy, it's always Misty 
Some times some thing flies out of the mist
and hits me.
Usually it's a frisbee.

// Kat ---> Later Mom!
// Liz ---> Bye Bye Kat’s mom!
// Kat ---> +++++
// Liz ---> Wait, did that just happen?
// Kat ---> +++++
// Liz ---> We just left your house without picking up your toys
// Kat ---> Oh yeah, I don’t do that.
// Liz ---> What?  Your parents don’t make you pick up your toys?
// Kat ---> Nope.
// Liz ---> What the?
// Kat ---> You know… It just wasn’t working for me.
// Liz ---> ++++
// Kat ---> Yeah, they are super cool.  Believe me though, they have tried. My dad made me this sticker chart.  And they actually had me picking up my toys for like a week when I was in preschool.  I think I got kinda be-dazzled by all the stickers or something.
// Liz ---> Were they puffy stickers?
// Kat ---> Yeah, totally, and glitter too.
// Liz ---> Whoa! Those ones dazzle me too.
// Liz ---> I can’t help it, they’re just so….uggggh!  I cant even think about them without having a cute attack.
// Kat ---> Liz, you are a cute attack!
// Liz ---> OMG, did I tell you about the time I saw my neighbors new puppy!  It was too cute!  Suddenly,  I just couldn’t stop myself.  I just took off running across the park.  I was like, I don’t care if I catch the corona virus, I am hugging that puppy!
// Kat ---> OMG, did you get in trouble?
// Liz ---> Yeah, well, kind of. , I mean, actually no.  My parents don’t understand punishing.  My dad got all worked up and put the Nintendo on the Consequences Shelf.  But we were playing again after lunch.
// Liz ---> Girl, you’ve got the magic!
// Kat ---> I know, right?  I should teach a class in this stuff.  And get this.  My parents actually pay me to not pester after the cat.
// Liz ---> Whoa!
// Kat ---> You trick is, you gotta train them early.  Their map of the world starts to harden right around kindergarten.
// Liz ---> Like play-doh?
// Kat ---> Just like play-doh.  So don’t miss your window. Or else you’re going to be in for years of work.
// Liz ---> Wow!  Just wow!  I am so bad at that stuff.
